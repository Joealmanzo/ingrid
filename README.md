Ingrid, the jquery Datagrid.

Datagrids don't have to be difficult to use anymore - say hi to Ingrid. Ingrid is an unobtrusive jQuery component that adds datagrid behaviors like column resizing, paging, sorting, row and column styling (and more) to your tables. 

Currently Ingrid lives here, will move to GH soon: http://reconstrukt.com/ingrid
